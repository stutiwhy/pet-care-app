      description: `
        **Natural Instinct**:
        - Birds are adept at hiding illness and injury as a survival mechanism. In the wild, showing signs of weakness can attract predators. This instinct remains in pet birds, making it crucial for owners to be vigilant and observant.
        
        **Importance of Observation**:
        - Regularly monitor your bird for any changes in behavior or health. Early detection is vital for timely intervention and recovery. If you notice any unusual symptoms, stay calm and act promptly.
