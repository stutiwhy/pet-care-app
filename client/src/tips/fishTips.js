        **Observation is Key**:
        - Look for normal behavior for the species you have. Healthy fish typically swim normally, act normally, eat well, and have good color and appearance. Behavioral changes may indicate stress, water problems, or disease.
  
        **Symptoms to Watch For**:
        - **Clamped Fins**: When fish hold their fins close to their body most of the time, rather than spreading them out. This may be accompanied by frayed fins or other symptoms like shimmies.
        - **Shimmies**: When the fish seems to swim in place without moving forward, often with clamped fins. Common in Livebearers like Mollies or Swordtails and may be caused by cool temperatures or temperature changes.
        - **Flashing**: When a fish bumps into objects or along the gravel repeatedly, attempting to 'scratch' itself. Frequent flashing may indicate external parasites.
        - **Schooling Behavior**: Schooling fish prefer to swim in groups. If one or two are not swimming with the main group, check for other symptoms. Small aquariums may limit natural schooling behavior.
        - **Swimming Behavior**: Fish have preferred swimming levels. For example, Danios near the surface and Angelfish throughout the tank. Changes in swimming behavior warrant investigation.

      description: `
        **Check Your Water First**:
        - Poor water quality is the cause of 90% of fish diseases. Ensure all water parameters are correct as poor quality can cause stress and environmental diseases, and suppress the fishâ€™s immune system.
  
        **Prevention Tips**:
        - **Quarantine New Fish**: Always isolate new arrivals to prevent introducing diseases.
        - **Observe New Fish**: Watch them before purchasing to ensure they are healthy.
        - **Maintain Water Quality**: Avoid exposure to ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate. Keep temperature and pH consistent.
        - **Good Nutrition**: Provide a balanced diet to maintain fish health.
  
        **Additional Tips for Sick Fish**:
        - **Aquarium Salt**: Can help soothe symptoms of infection.
        - **Temperature Adjustment**: Raising temperatures may speed up the life cycle of some external parasites.
        - **Medications**: Use carefully for specific illnesses. Be aware that some treatments may not be safe for plants or invertebrates.
        - **Act Early**: Address issues promptly to prevent spreading to other fish.
        - **Clean Up**: Clean the filter and perform a partial water change before treatment to improve overall health.
        - **Remove Activated Carbon**: It will remove medication from the water, so remove it before treating.
