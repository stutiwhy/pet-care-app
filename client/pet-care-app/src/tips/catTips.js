        **Initial Actions**:
        - Keep calm and assess the scene for any additional threats to you or your pet. This is crucial for everyone's safety.
        - Keep your cat warm (except in cases of heat stroke), as quiet as possible, and keep movement to a minimum, especially if there is possible trauma, broken limbs, or any neurological symptoms.
        - Contact your veterinary hospital immediately to inform them of the situation and get specific first aid advice.
        - To safely move or transport an injured cat, use a suitable container such as a strong cardboard box or a cat carrier (remove the top for easy and safe access; DO NOT push an injured cat through the small door or opening). Place a blanket or thick towel over the patient.
        - Get to the veterinary hospital as soon as possible.

        **Handling Panicked or Injured Cats**:
        - Most injured animals will be panicked, disoriented, or injured. The stress of an emergency can cause an otherwise friendly animal to act aggressively. Although a calm, soothing voice may help, use caution when approaching or touching any injured animal.
        - Muzzles are difficult to put on cats due to their face shape, and specific muzzles for cats are rarely available in emergencies. Instead, drape a towel over the cat's head to provide some measure of protection. Wrap the body of a frightened or unmanageable cat in a blanket or towel. Do not constrict the trachea or airway. Leave the head exposed unless your cat is very aggressive. Exercise caution if you suspect a fractured bone or spinal injury.
        - For suspected spinal injuries, lay your cat in a large box to minimize movement.

      title: "What is Shock?",
      description: `
        **Definition and Risks**:
        - Shock is a complex systemic reaction to severe trauma, hemorrhage, sudden blood loss, heart failure, or other causes of decreased circulation, such as severe allergic reactions or heat stroke. A life-threatening fall in blood pressure is a dangerous part of shock.
        - If not treated quickly and effectively, shock can cause irreversible injury to body cells and can be fatal.

      title: "Signs of Shock",
      description: `
        **Indicators of Shock**:
        - Rapid breathing (which may be noisy)
        - Rapid heart rate with a weak pulse
        - Pale mucous membranes (gums, lips, under eyelids)
        - Severe depression (listlessness)
        - Cool extremities (limbs and ears)
        - Vomiting may also occur.

        **First Aid Steps**:
        - Keep your cat as quiet as possible and try to conserve heat by covering them with blankets, towels, or even newspapers.
        - Follow the A, B, and Cs of first aid:
          - **Airway**: Ensure the airway is clear of obstructions like vomit or saliva. Be cautious as the cat may bite in panic.
          - **Breathing**: If your cat is unconscious and not breathing, gently pump the chest with your palm while checking for a heartbeat or pulse. If there is no heartbeat, give rescue breathing (see below). Be careful with injured pets as they may bite. If unsure of the petâ€™s health or vaccination status, avoid contact with bodily fluids and blood.
          - **Cardiac Function**: If there is no detectable heartbeat or pulse, press on the chest with your palm and elevate the lower half of the body to promote blood flow to the brain. Follow CPR steps if needed.

      title: "How to Perform Rescue Breathing for Your Cat",
      description: `
        **Steps for Rescue Breathing**:
        - Ensure an open airway and:
          - Carefully pull the tongue out of the mouth.
          - Extend the head and neck so they are in a straight line. Do not overextend if there is head or neck trauma.
          - Clear the mouth of debris that might obstruct breathing.
          - Place your hand over the cat's muzzle, holding the mouth shut, and extend the neck. A Styrofoam cup or similar object with a large hole can be used as an improvised breathing device if necessary.
          - Give two to three breaths by blowing into the nostrils. Provide 10 breaths per minute. If no chest rise is seen, reposition the neck or check for airway obstruction.
          - If rescue breathing fails, you may attempt acupressure by pressing firmly with your fingernail or another hard, dull object in the space between the nostrils and upper lip (nasal philtrum) for 10-30 seconds.

      title: "What to Do If Your Cat Requires CPR",
      description: `
        **CPR Instructions**:
        - If there are still no signs of life after establishing an airway and beginning rescue breathing, attempt chest compressions:
          - Ensure there is no major bleeding. If bleeding is present, have an assistant manage it while you perform CPR.
          - Lay your cat on its right side if possible.
          - Feel for a heartbeat or femoral pulse (located inside the leg in the groin region). Cats do not have a readily palpable carotid pulse.
          - Compress the chest using one hand, placing your fingers on one side and thumb on the other. Compress the chest 100-120 times per minute, about 30-50% of chest wall thickness (approximately 1" or 2 cm).
          - Provide 30 compressions for every two breaths.

      description: `
        **Veterinary Follow-Up**:
        - After being involved in an emergency or accident, take your cat for a veterinary examination as soon as possible, even if they appear to have recovered fully. This ensures that any hidden injuries or issues are addressed promptly.
