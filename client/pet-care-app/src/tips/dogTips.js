        **Symptoms of Choking**:
        - Difficulty breathing
        - Excessive pawing at the mouth
        - Choking sounds when breathing or coughing
        - Blue lips or tongue
  
        **How to Remove the Blockage**:
        If your dog is choking, look into their mouth to see if anything is visible. If you see something, gently try to remove it, but be careful not to push it further down their throat or be bitten.
  
        If your pet collapses or you can't remove the object, then:
        1. Place both hands on the side of your dog's rib cage and apply firm, quick pressure.
        2. Alternatively, lay them on their side and strike the rib cage firmly with the palm of your hand three or four times.
        3. Repeat until it dislodges or you arrive at the vet.
  
        **Not Breathing**:
        - Have someone call an emergency vet while you give first aid.
        - Check to see if your pet is conscious and has a heartbeat.
        - Open your pet's airway by gently grasping their tongue and pulling it forward out of the mouth until it's flat.
        - Check their throat for any blockages.
        - Close your pet's mouth and breathe into their nose until you see their chest expand. Continue once every five seconds. If your pet doesn't regain consciousness, get them to a vet as soon as possible.
  
        **No Heartbeat**:
        - Have someone call a vet immediately while you begin emergency first aid.
        - Feel and listen for a heartbeat.
        - Lay your dog on their side on a firm surface.
        - Place one hand under their chest for support and place the other over the heart (just behind the left front elbow).
        - Press down on your pet's heart 100-120 times per minute (press hard for larger animals and with less force for smaller ones).
        - Alternate every 30 compressions with two rescue breaths.
        - Continue until you hear or feel a heartbeat or you have arrived at a vet.

      title: "In an Emergency, What Should I Do First?",
      description: `
        **Initial Actions**:
        - Keep calm and assess the scene for any additional threats to you or your pet.
        - Keep your dog warm (except in the case of heat stroke), as quiet as possible, and keep movement to a minimum, especially if there is possible trauma, broken limbs, or any neurological symptoms.
        - Contact your veterinary hospital, inform them of the situation, and get specific first aid advice.
  
        **Transporting Your Pet**:
        - To safely move or transport an injured dog, get somebody to help you.
        - For a small dog, put them into their carrier (remove the top for easy and safe access) or use a suitable container like a strong cardboard box.
        - For a larger dog, use a makeshift stretcher made from rigid material like a sturdy piece of wood. Maneuver your dog onto a blanket or coat for gentle movement to the carrier, box, or stretcher.
  
        **Restraint and Calming**:
        - Most injured animals will be panicked and/or disoriented. Use caution when approaching or touching any injured animal.
        - Use restraint methods like muzzling, wrapping, or immobilizing to ensure safety.
